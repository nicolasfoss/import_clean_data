# Importing and Cleaning Data

Our boss at Crunching Numbers needs us to determine which match and stadium had the highest attendance during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. We use our data import and cleaning skills to dig through the dirty data, clean it up, and present our boss with polished graphs.

These data come from the online 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup match reports and are included in this repo.

All credit for this setup: Datacamp!
all coding to complete the exercises: me!
